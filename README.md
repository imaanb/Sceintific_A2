# Scientific Computing - Assignment 2
## Repo Structure

- [`src/`](./src/) - Source code implementations of the simulation models

- [`results/`](./results/) - Visualization outputs from the simulations (those used in the submitted assignment)
  - Contains plots of random walks, cluster growth, fractal dimension analysis, and Gray-Scott patterns

- [`gifs/`](./gifs/) - Animated visualizations of the simulations
  - Includes animations of random walkers and cluster growth processes

- [`runs/`](./runs/) - Saved simulation states and results
  - Contains pickled data from simulation runs with and without early stopping

- To run the simulations, open the [`Assignment.ipynb`](./Assignment.ipynb) notebook which contains step-by-step execution of the different models and analysis. The project assignment details can be found in [`assignment.pdf`](./assignment.pdf).

## Features

- Random walk simulations with varying parameters
